Wait in selenium:
1. Based on condition this selenium waits can apply on elemeents such (ExpectedCondition BasedonVisibilityOfText, visibilityOfelement, untilElementfound) etc.
2. as soon as above expected condition executed it will move next line of code or next course of action on test steps.
3. efficiently handles the application elements even though it loads late after the DOM and effectily executes the script without script failures.
4. Thread.sleep generic method can be replaced with element specific wait conditions.

Types of waits in selenium:
1. Implicit wait
This one time wait when DOM loads. every time page loads this implicit wait called.
2.Explicit wait
Conditions can be added to particular element to be selected or visibility- This is specific to particular element
3.Fluent wait.
element found but actions(click, selection, enabling) not performed on particular element can give specified time to wait to keep trying the same action on the element.
Wait wait = new FluentWait(driver).withTimeout(time).pollingEvery(time).ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class)
